Tom Barber - Team Profile Generator

Description: In the workplace, one can find themselves with the responsibility of managing a sizeable group of people. In situations like this, it can be useful to have one place where all of the relevant information about each employee is readily available.  To help with this need, I've developed an app that will allow employeers to create profiles for each person on their team.  This app uses node.js to have employeers create groups of interns, managers and engineers by filling out their imformation by providing some basic information.  Currently there are three classes of employee availabe to be grouped together.  The first improvement I would make in the future is to allow more classes to be used.
